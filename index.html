Responsive website are those websites which show layout according to the resolution of particular device but how this happens? How a website automatically get into the layout according to the resolution of device?<br><br>

				  Let’s take example of CSS. How CSS / CSS3 is helpful to obtain the mobile first approach towards any website. Well if you don’t know what is CSS then it’s a Cascading Style Sheets which is used to target any HTML document to give style and responsive layout. It’s very beautiful styling language to learn if you want to go for mobile web designing world. CSS use media queries to obtain the responsive of the websites. Media queries are one type of format in CSS which takes condition and act according to that condition. Here condition can also be called as a breakpoint. Now to understand breakpoints let’s take an example of any browser such as chrome, Firefox, IE etc. when we maximize the browser window at that time the browser width will be taken as 100% but when we drag browser windows into small size then its resolution varies and layout of website changes. Now when layout of website changes that particular moment is known as breakpoint. Now consider the breakpoint occurs when width comes to 60% then in the media query we give the condition that when width of the window comes to 60% then change the layout according to UI which looks good in that particular resolution and because of this responsiveness of website comes into existence.</p><br>

In this module the parts of the engine will be consider under variable and running of an engine with the use of its parts that is variables will come under method or we can say in the programming fundamentals that we are passing the variables to the methods and such types of methods are called as parameter method which return some value may be integer, floating etc.<br><br>Finally the whole combination of the variables and methods of the engine is called as engine class which is being used by many other engine objects to design an engine.

					<h1 class="display-3">Relationship between Client Server</h1>


					<hr>
					<p class="lead text-justify">
					When it comes to Internet we usually follows Client Server Relationship. Now how are they both interrelated. Why there are many client side programming languages and many server side programming language?
					<img src="COFFEE LOVERS.jpg" class="float-right set m-4">
					<br><br>
					Let us consider we are sitting on our personal computer (don't sit on the computer just side in the chair) now i am going to open google chrome and i will type www.google.com now what happens is the personal computer is consider as a client and we are sending some message or request to the server from the client that is www.google.com so here in this scenario client is the computer or you can say google chrome is the client or browser is the client and that client wants to chat with the server. when the message or request gone to the server which is www.google.com then server will check whether that particular domain name is available or not. 



					<br><br>
					Its like considering school library as a server and students as a client. if any student want to access any book than that particular school request for the book from the library than librarian will check weather that book is available or not.
					<br><br>
					Same as the above the client server relationship works. when that www.google.com will be found by server than server will respond to the client by showing the web page of www.google.com  
					<br><br>
					There are many programming language we are using as a server side programming and also as a client side programming. As according to the above paragraph when server respond to the client by showing a web page than that particular web page will be landed in the client platform only.</p></div>
